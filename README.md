This is a shiny weather dashboard that uses leafmap to select a location. After selecting a location, it will display the weather at that time. Additionally, it also includes a line chart that shows the differences in weather over time. The extension in my project is the addition of a location search table, allowing users to directly type in a location instead of selecting it on the map. However, it still has limitations in that the name must be entered correctly to display the results.
